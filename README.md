###  Question 1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
Ans: A typical internet website has two major components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to offer users with a functional and engaging online experience. Here's a breakdown of how the front-end and back-end divisions work:

**The front-end** , also known as the client-side, is the section of a website that users interact with directly through their web browsers. It emphasises on the website's presentation and user interface. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are key technologies used in front-end development.

Front-end developers are in charge of:

* Using HTML to create the structure and layout of online pages.
* CSS, which determines styles such as colours, fonts, and layouts, is used to improve the visual appeal of the website.
* Using JavaScript to implement interactivity and dynamic behaviour, such as animations, form validation, and user input processing.
* Responsive design strategies are used to optimise the website for multiple screen sizes and devices.

**Back-end** :
The server, database, and application logic that power the website comprise the back-end, often known as the server-side. It handles front-end requests, processes data, and conducts other actions to offer the necessary functionality. Back-end technologies include programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby, as well as frameworks such as Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel.

Back-end developers are in charge of:
* Creating server-side apps that handle client requests and respond appropriately.
* Developing the business logic and algorithms required for the website's functionality.
* Connecting to databases, storing and retrieving data, and maintaining data security are all part of the job.
* Using external services or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to add functionality or access external data.
* Optimising the back-end system's performance and scalability to accommodate large traffic and user loads.

Communication between the front and back ends:
Front-end and back-end components exchange data using standardised protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The front-end sends a request to the back-end server whenever a user interacts with it, for as by submitting a form or clicking a button. The server processes the request, performs the necessary operations, retrieves or updates data from the database, and sends a response back to the front-end. The front-end then renders the response received from the back-end and displays it to the user.
