###  Question 1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
Ans: A typical internet website has two major components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to offer users with a functional and engaging online experience. Here's a breakdown of how the front-end and back-end divisions work:

**The front-end** , also known as the client-side, is the section of a website that users interact with directly through their web browsers. It emphasises on the website's presentation and user interface. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are key technologies used in front-end development.
