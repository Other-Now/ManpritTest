###  Question 1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
Ans: A typical internet website has two major components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to offer users with a functional and engaging online experience. Here's a breakdown of how the front-end and back-end divisions work:

**The front-end** , also known as the client-side, is the section of a website that users interact with directly through their web browsers. It emphasises on the website's presentation and user interface. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are key technologies used in front-end development.

Front-end developers are in charge of:

* Using HTML to create the structure and layout of online pages.
* CSS, which determines styles such as colours, fonts, and layouts, is used to improve the visual appeal of the website.
* Using JavaScript to implement interactivity and dynamic behaviour, such as animations, form validation, and user input processing.
* Responsive design strategies are used to optimise the website for multiple screen sizes and devices.

**Back-end** :
The server, database, and application logic that power the website comprise the back-end, often known as the server-side. It handles front-end requests, processes data, and conducts other actions to offer the necessary functionality. Back-end technologies include programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby, as well as frameworks such as Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel.

Back-end developers are in charge of:
* Creating server-side apps that handle client requests and respond appropriately.
* Developing the business logic and algorithms required for the website's functionality.
* Connecting to databases, storing and retrieving data, and maintaining data security are all part of the job.
* Using external services or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to add functionality or access external data.
* Optimising the back-end system's performance and scalability to accommodate large traffic and user loads.

Communication between the front and back ends:
Front-end and back-end components exchange data using standardised protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The front-end sends a request to the back-end server whenever a user interacts with it, for as by submitting a form or clicking a button. The server processes the request, performs the necessary operations, retrieves or updates data from the database, and sends a response back to the front-end. The front-end then renders the response received from the back-end and displays it to the user.

###  Question 2. What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.
Ans: Tags in HTML are keywords that define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and usually come in pairs, such as <p> and </ p>. There are different categories of tags in HTML, such as:

* Document type declaration: This tag tells the browser what version of HTML the web page is using. For example, <!DOCTYPE html> is the tag for HTML5.
* HTML: This tag wraps the entire web page content. It has two subtags: <head> and <body>.
* Head: This tag contains information about the web page, such as the title, meta data, style sheets, scripts, etc. For example, <title>My Web Page< / title> sets the title of the web page.
* Body: This tag contains the main content of the web page, such as text, images, links, forms, etc. For example, <h 1>Welcome to My Web Page</ h 1> creates a heading with the text "Welcome to My Web Page".
* Structural: These tags define the layout and organization of the web page content. They include tags such as <div>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, etc. For example, <div id="main">...</div> creates a division with the id "main".
* Semantic: These tags provide meaning and context to the web page content. They include tags such as <p>, <em>, <strong>, <a>, <img>, etc. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p> creates a paragraph with the text "This is a paragraph".
* List: These tags create ordered or unordered lists of items. They include tags such as <ol>, <ul>, <li>, etc. For example, <ul><li>Apple</li><li>Banana</li><li>Orange</li></ul> creates an unordered list of fruits.
* Table: These tags create tables of data. They include tags such as <table>, <tr>, <td>, <th>, etc. For example, <table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th></tr><tr><td>Alice</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>30</td></tr></table> creates a table with two columns and three rows.
* Form: These tags create forms for user input. They include tags such as <form>, <input>, <label>, <button>, etc. For example, <form action="/submit" method="POST"><label for="name">Name:</label><input type="text" id="name" name="name"><button type="submit">Submit</button></form> creates a form with a text input and a submit button.
