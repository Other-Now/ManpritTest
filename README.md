###  Question 1. Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
Ans: A typical internet website has two major components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to offer users with a functional and engaging online experience. Here's a breakdown of how the front-end and back-end divisions work:

**The front-end** , also known as the client-side, is the section of a website that users interact with directly through their web browsers. It emphasises on the website's presentation and user interface. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are key technologies used in front-end development.

Front-end developers are in charge of:

* Using HTML to create the structure and layout of online pages.
* CSS, which determines styles such as colours, fonts, and layouts, is used to improve the visual appeal of the website.
* Using JavaScript to implement interactivity and dynamic behaviour, such as animations, form validation, and user input processing.
* Responsive design strategies are used to optimise the website for multiple screen sizes and devices.

Back-end:
The server, database, and application logic that power the website comprise the back-end, often known as the server-side. It handles front-end requests, processes data, and conducts other actions to offer the necessary functionality. Back-end technologies include programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby, as well as frameworks such as Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel.
